An Application based on Probability Prediction using Randomization Algorithms. Where winning probability of player and banker is calculated simultaneously with the simulation of game Baccarat.

##Baccarat

Baccarat is a game of cards which contains 8 decks. There are 416*415*414*413 possible cases in first hand
which makes it almost impossible to be followed for patterns/predictions. To be able to even calculate the
probabilities with a great deal of accuracy, it takes a large amount of time. Hence, it served as a suitable
problem statement that could be solved by our algorithms
